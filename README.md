# Hot Potato

Hot potato is an intercepting proxy that sits between an API and an API client, smoothly swapping certain specified responses for whatever mock or fake data you need in your client. (It matches URLs).

For ease of use, it also features a simple web interface running on the same port as the proxy itself, accessible at `HOST_NAME/hotpotato/public/index.html`. This interface is used to add, update and delete the "spuds": hot chunks of JSON data (or XML, if that's your kink) mapped to URLs.

## Installing

Clone the repository

    npm install

    node index <HOST> <LOCAL_PORT>

Navigate to the web interface and start adding spuds.

## Usage

To add a spud, enter a URL to intercept in the URL field (can include query parameters). Then in the spud textarea, put the response you want to be returned. Press 'Send'. Do the same to update an existing spud.

You can also add spuds manually by putting them in the `spuds` directory, ensuring the nested directories match the URL structure (there is no database).

Finally, you'll need to update your API client (web app, game, orchestration layer, etc.) to point at the proxy instead of the API.

## Notes

Yes, there's a lot of synchronous calls in there, but it's nice and readable, isn't it?
